consensus, to keep only one version of ledger valid

Decentralization 
Distributed Ledger:
This is the shared, electronic database where all transactions are recorded. Each block in the chain contains data, a timestamp, and a unique cryptographic hash of the preceding block, linking them together chronologically.
Cryptography:
It's used to secure the data within the blockchain.
Hashing: Creates unique codes for each block, acting as a digital fingerprint. If any data within a block is altered, its hash changes, and the link in the chain is broken, revealing tampering.
Public-Private Keys: Used to verify the authenticity of transactions and participants.
Consensus Mechanism:
